# AWS provisioning/automation examples
This subdirectory contains a few examples of AWS cloud deployments. Examples:
 
 - [**deploy_webserver**](https://github.com/MihaMarkocic/cloudservices/tree/master/AWS/deploy_webserver): Apache webserver and cloud storage deployment in a default network infrastructure. (*Ansible*)
 - [**vpc_infrastructure**](https://github.com/MihaMarkocic/cloudservices/tree/master/AWS/vpc_infrastructure) : basic VPC infrastructure with private/public subnets, IG, route table and webservers. (*Terraform & Ansible*)

In order to use and deploy these examples or similar infrastructure, an active *AWS* and/or *MS Azure* subscription is needed. Further, automation tool of choice should already be installed in your working environment.
